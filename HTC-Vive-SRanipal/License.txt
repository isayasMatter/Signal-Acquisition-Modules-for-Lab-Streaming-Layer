This software falls under the top level License.md file.

However, by linking to the SRanipal SDK (must be downloaded separately), you have to agree to their license agreement, 
which may have an impact on the conditions you are allowed to redistribute the resulting binaries under.  A copy of that license agreement is included for your reference as a courtesy here, but there is no guarantee that license copy is the latest version required by HTC.
